# 3TAI - A simple Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple tic tac toe game which consists of a bot created using the Minimax algorithm. 
Play with it for a while and if possible try to beat it.

## Problem statement
Two players (player X, and player O) play on 3x3 grid. Player X is a human player, and player O is an AI. A player can put his/her letter (either X or O) in an empty cell in the grid. If a player forms a row, a column or a diagonal with his/her letter, that player wins and the game ends. If the grid is full and thereâ€™s no row, column or diagonal of the same letter, the game ends at draw. A player should try to win in the lowest possible number of moves.

## The game was built using the following :

 - HTML, JS, CSS
 - Minimax Algorithm
